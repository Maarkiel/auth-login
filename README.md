## Description

This project demonstrates a simple authentication and authorization system using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT. It includes user registration, login, and access to protected routes with secure JWT-based authentication.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to register with a username, email, and password.
- **User Login**: Authenticates users and provides a JWT for accessing protected routes.
- **Protected Routes**: Secured endpoints that can only be accessed with a valid JWT.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
